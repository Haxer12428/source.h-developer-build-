Me from 2024: This code is a fucking masterpiece for neverlose I didn't really belived that I coded soo good at that time! I remember when I couldn't think of how to do config system based on a motherfucking for (v,k) loop in lua....
Now im coding a motherfucking 2d gui library on top of imgui, opengl and glfw (+ some other like json, glm etc) but I hated time I wrote this atm but I think it was one of the best momement's in my life. Better one was on old nvl
that was a motherfucking dream. I hated it that resolver was missing but that was the whole fun. Rushing 4 ppl with tec9 and everytime killing them all cause my motherfucking lua written by 15yo at the time was better than paid
luas those fukcer used that were coded by 'real' developers, they might be developers in hvh community but no motherfucker at that time coded this good of a code. They were aiming for simplicity when I was aiming for best performance
. Simplicity in my term is lack of skill. Simpler your code the better but if you write a spaggeti and call it 'simplicity' trust me no real developer will belive your lies! Thats all for now (still no gf btw). For future me: keep it real
current moments are better when you get past them!
